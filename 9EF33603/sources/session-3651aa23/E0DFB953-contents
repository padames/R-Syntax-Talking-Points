## The Talking Points


## Part 1

Variables, Values, Operators: Relational, Logical, mathematical, built in functions.

Data types and data structures.

Using the = ( the equal sign) assignment operator:

to give a value to a named variable exclusively within the scope of a function. 


The named variable does not exist outside of the function call. 

For named variables, the <- (left arrow operator) or -> (right arrow operator) have global scope, 
so variables created via these operators are not exclusive to the function,
the way the named variable mechanism works.

This is used throughout R.
